			the exact position of every shot you make, give you detailed statistics on your group size and much more. You can practice shooting 
			from a holster and have competitions with your friends!">

						<p>
							Each shot you take is recorded by the software, giving you statistics such as your group size and 
							average distance to the center of the target. Additionally, there are several different shooting 
							modes, illustrated below.
						</p><br><p>
							With the high cost of ammunition, it becomes difficult to go shooting often. For the cost of a couple 
							trips to the range, the Rangemaster SRS lets you shoot every night. Putting time into dry fire practice 
							can greatly improve your shooting skills. The Rangemaster SRS does not replace going to the range, but 
							it makes your time spent at the range much more effective. If you're serious about improving your handgun 
							skills, this is the product for you.
