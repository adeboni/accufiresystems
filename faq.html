			<h2 class="featurette-heading">How accurate is the detection of the Rangemaster SRS?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">
				Accuracy depends on distance of the camera from the target. 
				With the camera at 1.5 feet from the target, accuracy of  
				+/- 1/10th of an inch has been demonstrated through testing.

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">I installed Java 7 or 8 on my Mac, why isn't it working?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">
				OS X usually comes with Java 6 installed tends to always revert to it despite having installed a newer version. If this is happening to you, you have to uninstall Java 6.

			<hr class="featurette-divider">
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Why am I getting double hit detections for each shot in the Rangemaster SRS?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">
				This can happen if the laser beam stays on the target for too long. A common cause for this is that the 
				batteries in your laser may be dying and need to be replaced.
			</p></span>
		 
			<hr class="featurette-divider">
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Why is the Rangemaster missing some of my shots?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">This can occur for a number of reasons:</p><ol>
				<li><p>
					The software may be running slowly on your computer, which may happen if your computer does not meet the minimum 
					hardware requirements or has background processes running that take resources away from the Rangemaster SRS. Try 
					closing any unnecessary open applications like your web browser or email. One way of helping this problem is to lower the 					framerate of the Rangemaster SRS by going to the camera settings at the top of the program and selecting a lower frame rate.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					The lighting conditions may not be good. The Rangemaster SRS can sometimes have a hard time detecting your shots in 
					certain lighting conditions. Try changing the brightness of the room and make sure the room is not too bright. In 
					general, direct sunlight should be avoided.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					The camera may be frozen. Sometimes webcams can freeze and stop transmitting video to the computer. If this happens,
					try restarting the Rangemaster SRS.
				</p></li>
			</ol></span>
			
			<hr class="featurette-divider">
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Why is the Rangemaster SRS getting false detections?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">This can occur for a number of reasons:</p><ol>
				<li><p>
					False detections can occur if there are shadows moving in the camera's viewing area. Try not to walk by the camera or place
					the camera near an open window that can throw moving shadows on the target.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					The camera is seeing something else than the target. Try to have just the target and an empty wall in your camera's viewing 
					area. Things like clocks and other objects, especially reflective objects, can cause false detections.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>
					Movement of the webcam can cause false detections. Make sure the webcam is securely mounted to prevent any slight movements.
				</p></li>
			</ol></span>
			
			<hr class="featurette-divider">
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">What if the wrong camera is being used by the Rangemaster SRS?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">
				Go to the camera settings at the top of the Rangemaster SRS and select the camera you want to use. If your camera does 
				not appear on the list, you may need to restart the Rangemaster SRS. If it still does not appear, your computer may not have the 
				correct drivers for your camera.
			</p></span>
		 
			<hr class="featurette-divider">
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">What if the camera image looks corrupted?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">
				Try changing the USB port the camera is plugged into, preferably one on the back of you computer. A corrupted image happens more 
				often if you use a USB extender.
			</p></span>

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Where can I get more targets?</h2>
			<span class="text-muted"><p class="lead">You can download our targets here:</p>
				<div class="well well-sm">
					<a href="targets/circle_8.5x11.pdf">Circular Target (8.5 x 11 inches)</a>
					<br><a href="targets/area_8.5x11.pdf">Area Shooting Target (8.5 x 11 inches)</a>
					<br><a href="targets/idpa_8.5x11.pdf">Competition Silhouette Target (8.5 x 11 inches)</a><br>

					<br><a href="targets/idpa_11x17.pdf">Competition Silhouette Target (11 x 17 inches)</a>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">You can also print your own targets by making them yourself or getting them from a site like:</p>
				<div class="well well-sm">
					<a href="http://www.mytargets.com">www.mytargets.com</a>
					<br><a href="http://www.reloadbench.com">www.reloadbench.com</a>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Make sure you mark a ten-inch long section on the target so the Rangemaster SRS can accurately tell you your group sizes.</p>
